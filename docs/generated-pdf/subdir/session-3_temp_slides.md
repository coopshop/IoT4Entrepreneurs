//ST: 1. Objectives of the course

//ST: !

- Business models and IoT: an example
- What to do next? Publishing best works
- What to do next? Data x IoT

//ST: 2. How did it feel?

//ST: !
"Feeling" is an unsual term to describe a course / project_title

-> the point is to stress the *cultural* novelty you encountered:

//ST: !
In business schools, you acquire skills such as "conducting marketing research" or "knowing the principles of accountancy".

When you think of it, this kind of skills are characterized by:

//ST: !
- difficulty / error / failure: memorizing courses is hard, lack of experience in marketing can mean poor judgement.
- equipment: Word, Powerpoint, Excel

//ST: !
- information search / knowledge acquisition: attending lectures, reading books and memorizing, practising cases.
- types of output: presentations in class with ppt, written report as a Word doc, written exams.

//ST: !
- length / time: time spent on reading and memorizing

//ST: !
- quality / excellence: nuanced and rich judgement. Knowledge and correct application of accountancy procedures.

//ST: !
You practiced something different. Building this connect object, you did:

//ST: !
- difficulty / error / failure: not knowing where the error comes from. Is it the code? The object? The token? The computer? The cable? Poor documentation or documentation for engineers.

//ST: !
- equipment: an object, a software, a cable, a soldering station, computers in the Makers Lab, 3D printers. Equipment is diverse and potentially poorly documented.

//ST: !
- information search / knowledge acquisition: attending lectures, reading the pdfs, but also a lot of self search and trial and error.

//ST: !
- types of output: an artefact that works. Deviation from the "model" is ok. You are in control.

//ST: !
- length / time: contrary to purely

//ST: !
- quality / excellence: getting something that works and which is *engaging*:

1. Esthetics: is it beautiful? is it pleasing to use?
2. Utility: does it provide a useful service?
3. Ergonomics: is it simple, easy and comfortable to use? Does it lead to repeat use?
