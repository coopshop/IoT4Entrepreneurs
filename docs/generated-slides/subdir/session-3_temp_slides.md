==  1. Objectives of the course

==  !
- Recap: how does it *feel* building an IoT?
- Business models and IoT: an example
- What to do next? Publishing best works
- What to do next? Data x IoT

==  2. How did it feel?

==  !
"Feeling" is an unsual term to describe a course / project_title

-> the point is to stress the *cultural* novelty you encountered:

==  !
In business schools, you acquire skills such as "conducting marketing research" or "knowing the principles of accountancy".

When you think of it, this kind of skills are characterized by:

==  !
- difficulty / error / failure: memorizing courses is hard, lack of experience in marketing can mean poor judgement.
- equipment: Word, Powerpoint, Excel

==  !
- information search / knowledge acquisition: attending lectures, reading books and memorizing, practising cases.
- types of output: presentations in class with ppt, written report as a Word doc, written exams.

==  !
- length / time: time spent on reading and memorizing

==  !
- quality / excellence: nuanced and rich judgement. Knowledge and correct application of accountancy procedures.

==  !
You practiced something different. Building this connect object, you did:

==  !
- difficulty / error / failure: not knowing where the error comes from. Is it the code? The object? The token? The computer? The cable? Poor documentation or documentation for engineers.

==  !
- equipment: an object, a software, a cable, a soldering station, computers in the Makers Lab, 3D printers. Equipment is diverse and potentially poorly documented.

==  !
- information search / knowledge acquisition: attending lectures, reading the pdfs, but also a lot of self search and trial and error.

==  !
- types of output: an artefact that works. Deviation from the "model" is ok. You are in control.

==  !
- length / time: contrary to purely

==  !
- quality / excellence: getting something that works and which is *engaging*:

1. Esthetics: is it beautiful? is it pleasing to use?
2. Utility: does it provide a useful service?
3. Ergonomics: is it simple, easy and comfortable to use? Does it lead to repeat use?


==  3. An example of a business model with IoT

Withings is a company born in France in 2008. It designs connected objects in a B2C market:

In 2017, Nokia fades away the Withings brand and develops its digital health solutions:

==  !
The value proposal of Nokia's solution is not to sell more Iot. It consists in providing servicing, enabled by IoT.

Note: this is the latest development of an old trend, which is the "servicing economy":

==  3. What to do next?


==  !
==== 1. Publishing best videos
==  !
Goal of the http://data.em-lyon.com[Data R&D Institute]: pushing forward and publicly what emlyon business school does in data science.

==  !

==  !
==== 2. You must continue developing an interest in IoT x dataviz

==  !
There is a convergence between IoT, data science and AI. See the https://blog.google/topics/machine-learning/introducing-aiy-vision-kit-make-devices-see/[AYT Kit released by Google]:
